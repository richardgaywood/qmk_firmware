## Notes on my forked repo

I only use this fork to hold custom keyboards and any other config that cannot live inside a QMK userspace. My keymaps are in https://github.com/richardgaywood/keymaps-qmk, which is the more interesting place to look.

Note also that all changes to code in this repo are in branches, I keep `master` clean for pulls from upstream.
